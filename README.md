# Marvelous 

In early 2014, Marvel Comics released a groundbreaking API that allowed users to view a vast archive of their comic book history.

'Marvelous' is a simple 'Marvel Comics' web application that takes the rich history of Marvel and turns it into a vivid online comic museum! Users can search for comic titles based off specific Marvel superheroes and add their favorite cover artworks into their own personal collection!
